                    <p>During my freshman year at Brown, I took a psychology class called Making Decisions. 
                    Throughout the semester, I learned about the psychology of human decision-making and how 
                    it impacts both individual action and behavior as well as social policy. I became fascinated 
                    by how consumers make decisions in their daily lives and wanted to learn more about consumer 
                    psychology research. So, that summer, I collaborated with Professor Uma Karmarkar from the 
                    Rady School of Management at UCSD and designed a study to research how the familiarity of display 
                    items impacts display-set effects in consumer decision-making.
