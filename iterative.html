                    This was a group project for CSCI1300: UI/UX. The purpose of this project was to design an interface for an emerging startup. 
                    My group began by sketching out ideas for the interface and making wireframes based on our favorite sketches. 
                    Then, we made multiple iterations of a high-fidelity prototype. 
                    After receiving feedback on our prototype from our peers as well as an industry guest, 
                    we made changes to our prototype and submitted it to a user testing service.

                For this project, we chose Milkrun as our startup.  
                Milkrun is an online marketplace that connects city dwellers to local
                food products by mitigating both the time spent and steps taken for food delivery
                and distribution. It supplies fresh groceries in a timely manner and helps customers establish real relationships with local farms. Taking a user-centric
                approach, we designed a website that allows users to purchase groceries 
                from local stores and subscribe to a grocery-delivery service.

                    Before meeting up to work on the lo-fi wireframes and hi-fi mockups,
                    each member created initial sketches for the website. For my sketch, I focused on usability. I wanted users to be able to 
                    find the nearest shopping location as soon as they land on the homepage. I also hoped 
                    that the interface would allow users to add items to their shopping cart and remove 
                    items with ease.

                Critique & Feedback:
              </div>
              <div id="p">
                My group participated in a critique session with other students from the course 
                and received some critiques regarding our hi-fi mockup. Below, I have included a list of the critique feedback.   
              </div>
              <div id="p">
                <ol>
                  <li>Having both “Our Stores” and “Shop” tabs in the navigation bar is confusing because the selection of stores mainly acts as a filter when users are shopping. Create a hierarchy of functionalities and build other functionalities off of that. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The “Update” button in the “Shopping Cart” page isn’t necessary because it requires an extra click from users. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The Roberto Monospace font gives the company a technological aesthetic. Think about how typography conveys a message to users.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The +/- button in the “Shop” page is not consistent with the “Update/Remove” button in the “Shopping Cart” page.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Show item price in the “Shopping Cart” page. Don’t expect the users to remember the prices of each item. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The “Home” page doesn’t look scrollable because the “Find Your City” box and the “Subscribe” button aren’t very visible when the “Home” page first loads. 
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    It’s unnecessary to have to fill out new information on the checkout page when it should already be saved through the profile.

                      <li>
                        Removed the “Our Stores” tab in the navigation bar to maintain a consistent hierarchy of functionalities. Users can now navigate to the "Shop" page if they wish to see the entire selection of stores by clicking on the “Browse Stores” link under the “Producer” filter on the “Shop” page. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Removed the “Update” button on the checkout page to update the number of items in the cart because we decided it would be best if the prices and items are automatically updated without the need for an extra update button.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Changed our website font to one that has less of a technological feel.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Replaced the +/- button on the “Shop” page to an input box (similar to the one on the “Checkout" page) for more consistency.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Added the prices for individual items on the “Checkout" page.

                      <li>
                        Moved the “Find Your City” and “Subscribe” boxes up (so the tops of the boxes can be seen) to give an indication that there is more to be seen at the bottom of the homepage. 
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Edited the "Checkout" page so information is automatically filled and the user only needs to confirm that the information is correct or make necessary changes.

                    Overall, users thought the simplicity of the website was nice but lacked key information and visual
                    indicators. User confusion was further amplified by mistakes we made in setting up the user testing.
                    Due to our inexperience with the user testing website, we made the subtasks separate from the main task
                    with the assumption that the main task would be clearly visible, when that was not the case. This led to an
                    abnormally high focus on the “Select Location” page and lack of critique on the “Checkout” page. In the future,
                    we’d like to structure the user testing so that the subtasks and the main task are much more directly related.

                      <li>
                        Specify what kind of location users should enter into the search bar (they should be entering in their personal address).
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Add a “Select Location” module to the top navigation bar and show suggestions of user-inputted location in the dropdown menu when the user is searching for their location.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Modify item descriptions in the “Shop” page to be clearer on the exact quantity of a product being sold and for how much.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Remove the ability to navigate to the “Shop” page by clicking on the homepage banner. Add a small button to navigate to the advertised sale instead of making the entire banner responsive.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Replace the “Select Location” modal window with an entirely new page for clarity (or change the size of the modal window so it takes up the entire page and doesn’t show the design underneath).
                      </li>

                This was the first time I collaborated with other students on a UI/UX project. 
                It was a fun experience for me because it made me realize that everyone has a different design process. 
                It was especially fascinating to see how we were able to put our initial sketches together to create lo-fi wireframes
                and hi-fi mockups. Furthermore, through this project, I had the opportunity to receive and give design critiques, which helped me to be more open to other  
                design choices. I also enjoyed conducting user tests because it allowed me to see how other users who are not familiar with 
                the interface respond to the changes we made to the interface.
