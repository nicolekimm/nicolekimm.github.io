                    Canvas, also known as Canvas Student, is an app that helps students and instructors access their courses. 
                    Students can view their grades and submit assignments, while instructors can assign assignments and leave feedback. 
                    As someone who is always logged on Canvas (mostly on desktop), I found some features that could be added or improved. I decided to redesign the Canvas desktop 
                    app to enhance usability.

                        For example, the dashboard page doesn’t display the user's name. 
                        If I came across a random canvas account and viewed the dashboard page, 
                        I might mistake it for my own.

                        For example, to view a course’s assignment or syllabus, 
                        I have to click on the course’s icon in the dashboard page 
                        and then click on the tab for the assignment or syllabus.

                space where they can be their authentic selves.

                I created two user personas: Alex Bandura, a CS student at Brown University,
                who uses Canvas to check and submit assignments and look at deadlines, and Max Foreman,
                an English student at Brown University, who uses Canvas to check and submit assignments, 
                answer discussion questions, and connect with other students.

                        <b>Personalized To Do List:</b>
                        The Canvas app currently has a general-purpose to do list that includes all upcoming assignments.
                        It can't be edited, and thus is frustrating to use since some assignments may have priority over others. 
                        A personalized to do list will allow users to add or delete things on the list. Once a task is finished, 
                        users can click on the check mark and the task will be marked as done. They can also move the to do cards 
                        around to prioritize certain tasks.

                    <li>
                        <b>Welcome Header:</b> 
                        The welcome header displays "Welcome, (name)," making the account look and feel more personal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Upcoming Deadlines section:</b>
                        This allows students to quickly check upcoming assignments.

                        <b>Direct Messaging:</b>
                        This feature is handy for students to communicate with instructors and other students. 
                        Students don't have to write an email to instructors; instead, they can send a message through Canvas.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Accessible Icons:</b>
                        Even though Canvas already has some icons, such as the assignment icon, under each class, 
                        it will be more convenient for students if there are other icons as well. This includes the grade icon, 
                        which will allow students to check their grade for a specific class without having to click on the class first.

                        In the beginning of the semester, I often forget the time and location of my classes.
                        Due to Covid-19, I am staying at home on the West Coast, which makes time even more
                        confusing since my schedule at Brown is 3 hours ahead. It would be convenient if each
                        class lists the time and location right on the course page.

                    <li>
                        <b>Upcoming assignments and recent feedback:</b>
                        Most of the time, the reason that I am on Canvas is to look at upcoming assignments and feedback. 
                        Thus, these two should be displayed directly on the course page for easy navigation.

                        Right now, the user is unable to see who is in the section unless they click on the people section in the tab.
                        Now, all the people in the section are displayed on the group page so that students can check who else is in the same section.

                        <b>Distinguish between replies and posts:</b>
                        On the Canvas discussion page, it is challenging to tell the difference between replies and stand-alone posts.
                        When a post has multiple replies, it takes a long time to scroll through each reply. The redesign allows users
                        to click and see replies for each post. Users may also see replies to their own post for a specific discussion by clicking
                        "New Post Replies."

                <div id="p">
                    This project made me think about how different students use and interact with the Canvas App.
                    Although I believe that this redesign cultivates a welcoming environment where students
                    can easily access assignments and connect with others, there are still some changes that can be made.
                    Currently, I think there should be a feature that filters notifications. I often receive too many notifications
                    from Canvas, many of which are not relevant. To make Canvas reduce "noise," it would be an interesting challenge
                    to design a feature that helps users gain more control of which notifications they receive.
