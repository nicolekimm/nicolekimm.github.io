                    This was a project for the course CSCI1300: UI/UX at Brown University. For this project, I redesigned the homepage of Mostra Coffeeâ€™s website. 
                    Mostra Coffee is a local coffee shop in San Diego, and as a coffee lover, I go there at least once a week. 
                    I redesigned the homepage to improve usability and learnability. I identified problems in the original website, 
                    created low-fidelity wireframes and high-fidelity prototypes to fit different screen sizes, and used the 
                    prototypes as a guideline to build a new responsive website.

             <li>
              <b>No hierarchy of elements.</b> There is a hamburger menu in the top left corner
              of the website with the following options: Order To Go, Shop, About, Locations & 
              Menu, and Contact. However, the same options are also scattered throughout the website. 
              The website not only repeats the same information but also shows no hierarchy in the information.

              <li>
                <b>Too many clicks required to complete a single task.</b> For instance, to find a nearby location,
                a user has to click on the Locations & Menu button. Instead of forcing users to click a button 
                to find this information, it might be useful to just display it in the homepage.

            <div id="p">

                <b>Minimal white space.</b> There is not much white space throughout the homepage,
                and it is clumped with a lot of text and images.

                <b>Unnecessary buttons.</b> When a user clicks on the Locations & Menu option, 
                the website navigates to another page with the different locations. Under each location,
                there is a View Menu button. However, when one clicks on the View Menu button, the menu
                that is displayed is the same for all the locations. Thus, it might be helpful if the 
                website has just one central Menu button in a navigation menu so that new users know 
                that the menu is the same for all the locations.

              Accessability Findings:
              </div>
              <div id="p">
                After using WebAIM WAVE on the original website, 
                I found that the website does not have a heading structure. 
                I also noticed that one of the titles in the homepage has very low contrast, 
                making it difficult for users to read the title since it is displayed over an image. 
                There were two missing form labels for input boxes where users may input their 
                name to join the Mostra Coffee community. When I tested the website 
                by using a screen-reader, I noticed that because of these missing form labels, the screen-reader 
                was unable to detect these input boxes. In addition to missing form labels, there were two empty 
                form labels, one for a hamburger menu and one for an image. When using voice over to test the website, 
                I found that when I clicked on the hamburger menu, it said that I was on an image. 
                Then, when I pressed on the image, the voice over said I was on heading level 1. It seemed like the 
                voice over could not actually detect whether I was on the hamburger menu or the image.

                    To test the accessibility of the redesigned website, I played with the size of the browser
                    to see how the website looks in different screen sizes. I was able to see that the website
                    is responsive! For instance, the navigation bar changed into a hamburger menu when I made
                    the size of the browser as small as a tablet screen or a mobile phone screen. I also tried
                    changing the font size on my browser. When I made the font size really large on Google Chrome,
                    I noticed that it made the hamburger menu become not aligned to the logo for the mobile phone screen.
                    I fixed this problem by making the font size smaller for the logo for the mobile phone screen.

              This project made me think about how a layout in a website may look different based on the screen size. 
              I empathized with users and thought about their needs and motivations for looking at a particular website, and 
              I didn't realize how much work it took to design different layouts for one page of a website. Through this project, 
              I was also able to improve my skills in HTML/CSS and gain more experience in creating wireframes and prototypes.
