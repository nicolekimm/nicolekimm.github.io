                    This was a project for the course CSCI1300: UI/UX at Brown University. For this project, I modified an existing interface (the A interface) for an online succulent store and performed an A/B test
                    to learn the impacts of two different UI designs.

              The A and B interfaces presented an online succulent store, in which users were able to add different cacti
              to their shopping cart and go to checkout,. For the A/B tests, the users were asked to purchase $150 worth of cacti. When the user clicked on the link 
              to the cacti website, they randomly landed on either the A interface or the B interface.

                Hypotheses:
            </div>
            <div id="p">
                When running the statistical tests, I looked at two metrics:
                time to completion and return rate. In this case, the time to completion represents the time it takes for the user to 
                complete the desired task (purchasing $150 worth of cacti), and the return rate represents the number of times the user returns
                to the main shopping cart page from the checkout page. Before analyzing the results, I came up with a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis for each metric. 
            </div>
            <div id="bold">
                Hypotheses for Time to Completion:
            </div>
            <div id="p">
                Null hypothesis: The time to completion for A and the time to completion for B are equal. 
            </div>
            <div id="p">
                Alternative hypothesis: The time to completion for A is less than the time to completion
                for B because the add to cart options are vertically aligned with the images of the cacti, allowing users to read the text quickly from top to bottom. 
            </div>
            <div id="bold">
                Hypotheses for Return Rate: 
            </div>
            <div id="p">
                Null hypothesis: The return rate for A and the return rate for B are equal. 
            </div>
            <div id="p">
                Alternative hypothesis: The return rate for A is higher than the return rate for B because the prices of the cacti are further away from the images of the cacti as well as the + Cart button which may cause users to forget or not think about how much they are spending when pressing the + Cart button. 
                Thus, more users may find themselves checking their cart and returning to the main page.

            Data Collection Process: 
          </div>
          <div id="p">
            Our class tested each other's A/B sites to collect data. I first shared the 
            link to my cacti website, which included the A and B versions of the interface, to my classmates. 
            As mentioned before, the task was to fill the shopping cart with at least $150 worth of cacti, and each user
            randomly received either the A version or the B version of the interface. 
            After collecting the data, I extracted the data from logs that were recorded through the Heroku app, which I used to
            deploy my website. Then, I moved the data to an Excel spreadsheet in order to analyze the data.
            To prepare for the statistical analysis, I coded a Python script that calculated the metric for each statistical test. After moving the data to the spreadsheet, 
            I ran the script to get the results of the statistical tests.

            Takeaways:

          <div id="p">
            <li>One limitation of this A/B test is that the sample size is too small. Because I was only
              able to collect data from 24 users, my results may not be representative of a bigger population.
            </li>
          </div>
          <div id="p">
            <li>My data might have also been skewed because more users tested the B interface compared to the A interface. 
              While 16 users tested the B interface, only 8 users tested the A interface. 
            </li>
          </div>
          <div id="p">
            <li>It would be interesting if I ran the test with different populations. Because I ran the test with only students, 
              the results may have ben different if I ran the test with a different population, such as older adults.

                Concluding Thoughts:
            </div>
            <div id="p">
                This project made me realize the importance of statistical analysis in UI/UX design. 
                Although my statistical tests showed no significant difference between the A interface 
                and the B interface, I still learned that different UI designs on an interface can still
                have an impact on the user's experience in using that particular interface. I look forward to performing
                more A/B tests in the future, and I hope that if I find a significant difference, I would able to apply
                this finding to improve the design of the interface.
