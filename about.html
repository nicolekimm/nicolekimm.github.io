                            <p>Hi, I'm Nicole! I was born in Seoul and immigrated to San Diego at the age of 6. 
                                I'm currently a junior at Brown University, studying computer science. Coming to Brown, I thought I was going to concentrate
                                in cognitive neuroscience. During my first year, I took classes from multiple departments, including sociology, education, economics, and clps. To be honest, I felt a little lost. 
                                It wasn't until I tried my first cs class during the fall of my sophomore year that I finally felt like I knew what I wanted to pursue and learn. 
                                My academic interest lies in UI/UX design, and in particular, I am fascinated by how we can use UI/UX design to create a space that promotes inclusion and 
                                allows users to have their voices heard.</p>
                            <p>In my free time, you can find me obsessing over all things comedy. I enjoy watching Fleabag, scrolling through Twitter, and writing sketches.</p>
