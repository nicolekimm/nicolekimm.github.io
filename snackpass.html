                    Snackpass is a mobile app that allows users to order their food ahead of time for either pickup or delivery. 
                    What makes Snackpass different from other food-ordering apps is that it feels like a social media app. 
                    When users place an order on Snackpass, they receive a reward point and can then send a reward point to a friend. 
                    By collecting enough reward points, users can earn deals from different restaurants. 
                    Through a friend feed, users can also see what their friends are ordering. 
                    Targeting college campuses across the United States, Snackpass can already be seen on 11 campuses. 
                    As someone who uses Snackpass on a regular basis when studying at Brown University, I noticed some limitations of the mobile app and decided to redesign it.

                </div>
                <div id="p">
                This project taught me the importance of accessibility and memorability. What design choices allow users to
                quickly access information and encourage them to use the app again? Although I believe that this redesign 
                improves navigation, there are some changes that can still be made. For example, from the user interview, I learned that it is difficult to receive a refund if a restaurant messes up its transaction.
                According to the Snackpass website, the user has to directly call the restaurant and request a refund. It would be 
                useful if there is a feature that allows users to request a refund without having to call the restaurant and wait
                for a response. This is something I am thinking about for a future project.
